# Clam
A Discord clan bot built using [Discord+PS](https://github.com/nuttmegg/discordpps) that uses JSON to store and get info on clans
<br><br>

# Features
Clam lets you create new clans then invite people to them and change parts of them <br>
Clan info uses embeds to display information so with that almost all parts of the embed are able to be changed in some way to fit the style of your clan
<br><br>

You can change things like name, description, icon, banner, and shout
<br><br>
